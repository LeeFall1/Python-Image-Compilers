SET ENVIROMENT PATH https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-python-path (BUT SELECT FFMPEG)

INSTALL PYTHON 3, then
SET ENVIROMENT PATH https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-set-python-path

WE WILL USE S:\EXAMPLE FOR OUR DIRECTIORY. MAKE A WORK DIRECTORY LIKE MINE..

S:\EXAMPLE\ffmpeg -i TEST.mp4 -map 0 -codec copy -f segment -segment_time 0:20 output%03d.mp4

SET SEGMENT TIME AND SOURCE MP4 LOCATION, OUTPUT WILL BE THE SAME FOLDER UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS EXAMPLE WE WILL GET BACK output000 & output001...THEN (FOR THE 2 EXAMPLE OUTPUTS) TYPE IN COMMAND PROMT "MD 1 2" AND THAT WILL MAKE THE 2 FOLDERS THAT WE CAN PUT THE SPRITES IN)

S:\EXAMPLE\ffmpeg -i output000.mp4 1/thumb%04d.png -hide_banner

S:\EXAMPLE\ffmpeg -i output001.mp4 2/thumb%04d.png -hide_banner

SPLITS THE 20 SEC SEGMENTS INTO SINGLE FRAMES

S:\EXAMPLE\py -3 pack_images-LUA.py 1/thumb*.png 1/output 15

S:\EXAMPLE\py -3 pack_images-LUA.py 2/thumb*.png 2/output 15

PYTHON COMMANDS TO COMPILE ALL FRAMES INTO ONE IMAGE. CHANGE PY SCRIPT DEPENDING ON HTML OR LUA SPECIFY THE FRAME INPUT FOLDER, TELL THE SCRIPT WHAT FRAMERATE THE SOURCE MP4 IS (15).

YOU WILL NOW HAVE 1 PNG'S AND 1 HTML IN EACH FOLDER, USE https://squoosh.app/ TO COMPRESS AND CONVERT TO JPEG. USE BELOW HELP FOR THE BEST RESULTS.

I RECOMMEND 10-20 SEC SEGMENTS 360-480P, 15FPS, 2000 KBPS/2000000 BPS. THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIRST! IMAGE/PNG CREATED, USE THAT TO GET A ROUGH IDEA ON FILE SIZE (5MB MAX UPLOAD FOR DU) CONVERTING IT TO JPEG @ https://squoosh.app/ FOR HTML/COHERANT LABS DONT GO BELOW 70% QUALITY... IF YOU CANT GET IT BELOW 5MB @ 70% THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO LOWER THE RESOLUTION/FPS/BITRATE A LITTLE. THEN DO THE SAME AGAIN UNTIL YOU GET IT UNDER 5MB, THEN YOU CAN MOVE ON TO THE REST OF THEM (DOING THEM ALL AND THEN FINDING OUT THERE IS NO WAY TO GET IT UNDER THE SIZE LIMIT IS A HUGE WASTE OF TIME). WITH THE LUA VERSION YOU DO EVERYTHING THE SAME BUT YOU CAN SET ANY QUALITY YOU WANT ON https://squoosh.app/ MEANING YOU CAN HAVE MORE FPS/RES AT THE COST OF QUALITY.... ITS A BALANCE
